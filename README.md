Annotated Training Images for Google Cloud Derby
=====

This project is a collection of annotated images for the [Cloud Derby project](https://www.cloudderby.io).
Images and annotations are contantly updated and most recent copy can be found 
in the Google Cloud Storage bucket (please refer to [project instructions](https://www.cloudderby.io/getting-started/instructions) for location details).

Annotations are made with Pascal VOC format and image files are organized in folders along with XML annotations.
Currently we parse single annotation per image even when multiple objects of the same kind can be found in the image.

Cloud Derby source code, build instructions, contact information, and further project details can be found on the [Project website](https://www.cloudderby.io).
